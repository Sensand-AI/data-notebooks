Based on Westpac "data categories", some data notebook ideas to investigate in future:

Growth rates
 - inter- and intra-annual graphs based on NDVI or NBR sentinel-2 indices
 - hotspots of poor vegetation/ healthy vegetation based on veg index difference 

Water availability/storage
 - ingest water bodies DEA data + waterways data from graphs
 - add floodshed analysis?
 - diff map of maximum surface area of dams vs current surface area to get idea of where water volumes sit currently vs maximum. 
    - Could try using sentinel-2 water indices or DEA water body monitoring datasets

Rainfall / Climatic data
 - notebook that can ingest BOM gridded weather/climate data and clip to bounding box


Property boundaries:
 - Use official land parcel data from govt to check user land parcels are within their legal boundaries

Misc
 - aggregation/ heatmap of historical tasks - show which paddocks require more attention?
 - linear regression to see links between vegetation health and farm practices (Jefferson mentioned wanting this)
 - get Global Forest Watch data fetching withoutbgoing via GEE as middleman


 this is a silly line of text becuase Jenna is checking if her work acc still works.
