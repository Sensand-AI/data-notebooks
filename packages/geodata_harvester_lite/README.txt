This package is a modified version of the geodata-arvester package published by the University of Sydney:
https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester

The package has been modified in the following ways:
 - reduced the number of modules for getting data. Only relevant modules for Sensand are included

TODO:
 - the original apckage uses a csv file with coordinates to define the data harvesting area. Instead, it should be modified to take a bounding box derived from a geojson.
